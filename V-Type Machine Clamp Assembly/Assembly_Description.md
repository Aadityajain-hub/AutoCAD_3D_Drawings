# V-Type Machine Clamp Assembly

## üîß Definition

A **V-Type Machine Clamp** is a work-holding device used to securely hold cylindrical or round workpieces during machining operations. The V-groove in the clamp block allows for precise and firm positioning, while the clamp arm and lead screw apply the necessary pressure to lock the part in place.

## üéØ Applications

- Holding round rods or pipes in milling, drilling, and grinding machines
- Toolroom fixtures for inspection or measuring
- Manufacturing jigs and fixtures for cylindrical workpieces
- Precise positioning in assembly or welding operations

## üß© Main Parts of the Assembly

Below are the components used in this 3D V-Type Machine Clamp Assembly:

### 1. **Clamp Arm**
- U-shaped arm used to apply downward pressure.
- Mounted above the fixture block to hold the object in place.

### 2. **Fixture Block**
- Base block with a V-groove for positioning cylindrical workpieces.
- Provides stable support during machining.

### 3. **Lead Screw**
- Threaded rod used to tighten the clamp arm.
- Transfers torque into linear clamping force.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Working Principle

1. The **fixture block** is placed on the machine bed and aligned properly.
2. A **round or cylindrical object** is positioned in the V-groove of the fixture block.
3. The **clamp arm** is placed over the object.
4. The **lead screw** is turned to press the clamp arm downwards.
5. As the lead screw tightens, it locks the workpiece firmly in position.

This setup ensures the part remains fixed without vibration or movement during operations like milling or drilling.

## üìé Notes

- Ideal for high-precision work on round components.
- This 3D model was created using **AutoCAD** to visualize the part interaction in a real clamping scenario.
- Each component was modeled separately and then assembled digitally.
