# ‚öôÔ∏è Plummer Block Assembly | AutoCAD 3D Project

## üîß What is a Plummer Block?

A **Plummer Block** (also called a bearing housing) is a mechanical base used to support a rotating shaft using compatible bearings. It maintains the alignment of the shaft while allowing smooth rotational motion and absorbing mechanical loads. It is designed to house a bearing securely and protect it from dust, dirt, and vibration.

## üèóÔ∏è Applications

Plummer blocks are widely used in:
- Conveyor systems
- Fans and blowers
- Agricultural machinery
- Gearboxes and compressors
- Rolling mills and industrial machines

They are essential wherever a **rotating shaft** needs to be **safely supported and aligned**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Working Principle

1. The **shaft** is placed inside the **bearing housing** (top + bottom).
2. The **body** acts as the base that holds the shaft-bearing unit.
3. The **cap** and **bolts** secure the housing from above, preventing movement.
4. **Nuts and lock nuts** are used to ensure tight, vibration-free locking.
5. The bearing allows the **shaft to rotate free**
