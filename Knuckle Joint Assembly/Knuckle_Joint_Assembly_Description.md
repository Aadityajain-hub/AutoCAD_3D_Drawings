# Knuckle Joint Assembly

## 🔧 Definition

A **Knuckle Joint** is a mechanical joint used to connect two rods under tensile load. It allows limited angular movement between the connected rods, making it suitable for flexible mechanical linkages.

## 🎯 Applications

- Suspension mechanisms
- Linkages in cranes
- Bicycle chains
- Trusses and bridges

## 🧩 Main Parts of the Assembly

Below are the parts used in this 3D Knuckle Joint Assembly:

### 1. **Rod**
- Acts as the connecting member.
- Transmits the applied load (typically tensile force).
- Connected at both ends — one to the fork and the other to external components.

### 2. **Fork**
- A double-pronged component.
- Holds the rod with the eye (or collar) in between.
- Provides support and structural alignment for pin insertion.

### 3. **Pin**
- Cylindrical pin used to connect the fork and rod.
- Passes through aligned holes in the fork and rod.
- Allows limited angular motion.

### 4. **Collar**
- A circular sleeve part.
- Used to guide or hold the pin in position.
- Helps in preventing lateral movement of components.

### 5. **Taper Key**
- A wedge-shaped component.
- Used to lock the pin or collar in place securely.
- Prevents rotation or sliding of critical parts.

## ⚙️ Working Principle

1. The **rod** is placed between the prongs of the **fork**.
2. Holes in the fork and rod are aligned.
3. The **pin** is inserted through these aligned holes.
4. The **collar** helps center the pin and reduce wear.
5. The **taper key** locks the assembly, ensuring the pin doesn’t come loose during motion.

This joint allows slight angular flexibility while maintaining a strong connection, making it ideal for various mechanical link systems.

## 📎 Notes

- This joint type is used when parts need to be frequently assembled/disassembled.
- The design ensures both flexibility and rigidity depending on load direction.
