# Worm Gear Assembly

## 🔧 Definition

A **Worm Gear Assembly** is a gear arrangement that consists of a **worm (screw)** and a **worm gear (helical gear)**. It is used to transmit motion and power between two non-parallel, non-intersecting shafts — typically at a 90° angle. This setup provides high torque output and significant speed reduction in compact spaces.

## 🎯 Applications

- Elevators and lifts  
- Conveyor systems  
- Automotive steering mechanisms  
- Tuning instruments (e.g., guitars, telescopes)  
- Machine tools and material handling equipment

## 🧩 Main Parts of the Assembly

Below are the components used in this 3D Worm Gear Assembly:

### 1. **Worm Shaft**
- A threaded cylindrical shaft (resembles a screw).
- Drives the worm gear by rotating about its own axis.
- Transfers torque to the gear with high reduction ratio.

### 2. **Worm Gear**
- A helical gear meshed with the worm shaft.
- Mounted on the **drive shaft** to rotate perpendicular to the worm.
- Converts motion from the worm into rotational output.

### 3. **Drive Shaft**
- The output shaft connected to the worm gear.
- Transfers rotary motion from the gear to the external system.

### 4. **Mounting Flange**
- Circular plate used for fixing the assembly onto a base or housing.
- Ensures secure positioning of components.

### 5. **Alignment Pins**
- Cylindrical pins used for precise alignment of parts.
- Helps in assembling or maintaining accurate positioning.

## ⚙️ Working Principle

1. The **worm shaft** is rotated by a power source (motor/handle).
2. As the worm turns, its threads push against the teeth of the **worm gear**, causing it to rotate.
3. This motion is transferred to the **drive shaft**, producing output torque.
4. The worm’s design allows for high gear reduction in a compact space.
5. Due to friction and the angle of engagement, worm gears are also self-locking in some configurations (i.e., the gear cannot drive the worm).

## 📎 Notes

- Worm gear drives offer high torque output with low speed.
- Ideal for applications requiring locking capability and space-saving transmission.
- This model was designed in **AutoCAD 3D**, with each component built individually and assembled for educational and design visualization.
