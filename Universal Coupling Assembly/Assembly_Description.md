# Universal Coupling Assembly

## üîß Definition

A **Universal Coupling** (also called a Hooke‚Äôs Joint or U-Joint) is a mechanical component used to transmit rotary motion between two shafts that are not in a straight line. It allows angular misalignment between the shafts while maintaining torque transmission, making it ideal for dynamic mechanical linkages.

- Aircraft control systems  
- Agricultural and construction machinery  
- Machine tools and conveyor systems  
- Marine propulsion systems

## üß© Main Parts of the Assembly

Below are the parts used in this 3D Universal Coupling Assembly:

### 1. **Center Block**
- The main rotating cross that connects both forks.
- Transfers motion from one fork/shaft to the other at an angle.

### 2. **Fork**
- U-shaped component connected to the shaft.
- Holds the center block using pins to allow angular movement.

### 3. **Shaft**
- Cylindrical rod transmitting rotary motion.
- One shaft is input and the other is output.

### 4. **Collar**
- Helps guide and position the shaft and fork.
- Adds structural stability.

### 5. **Pin**
- Cylindrical component used to join the forks to the center block.
- Allows pivotal movement of the joint.

### 6. **Taper Pin**
- A conical locking pin.
- Prevents parts like the pin or shaft from slipping.

### 7. **Parallel Key**
- Rectangular key used to lock the shaft and fork rotationally.
- Ensures torque is transferred without slippage.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Working Principle

1. The **center block** is placed between two **forks**, each attached to a **shaft**.
2. **Pins** connect the center block to the forks, allowing each shaft to rotate at an angle.
3. The **parallel key** and **collar** help fix the shaft and ensure correct rotation.
4. **Taper pins** are used for locking to prevent axial displacement.
5. As one shaft rotates, the motion is transferred through the center block to the second shaft, even if their axes are inclined.

The universal joint allows rotational movement with angular misalignment, making it very flexible and useful in dynamic machinery.

## üìé Notes

- Ideal for applications requiring flexibility in transmission alignment.
- This model was created in **AutoCAD 3D** to simulate mechanical working and component fit.
- All parts were modeled individually and assembled virtually.
